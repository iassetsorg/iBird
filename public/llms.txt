> A Web3 decentralized social media and SocialFi platform built on the Hedera blockchain.

## About

iBird is a Web3 SocialFi platform that enables users to post, share, and interact with content stored immutably on the Hedera blockchain. All messages, posts, threads, and polls are stored on Hedera Consensus Service topics, ensuring transparency, permanence, and decentralization. Users can monetize their content through tips and engage in a token-powered social ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Polls**: Create on-chain polls with transparent voting
- **Channels**: Broadcast-style communication for announcements

- **Tipping (SocialFi)**: Send HBAR, ASSET, or 10+ tokens directly to content creators
- **Profile NFTs**: Unique on-chain identity with NFT profiles
- **Censorship-Resistant**: Content cannot be deleted once posted to blockchain
